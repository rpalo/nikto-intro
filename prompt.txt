One of the many reasons the security professional needs to know Linux is due to the many open source applications. The book covers many of these applications. You can also find many on the Internet by doing a simple search (example: search for the "top 100 security tools"). You will find many - such as: port scanners, packet sniffers, password crackers, log parsers, pen testing tools, etc. You would need a lot of free time to install and teach yourself each of these useful applications. Therefore, the purpose of this assignment is to have each of you select and learn about an open source tool. The project scope is to demonstrate that you can install and use an open source tool.

You will select, research, and install one open source tool. You will then create a presentation to help your peers learn how to install and use the tool that you selected.

You should include screenshots in your PowerPoint presentation; and
You should use the notes area to describe what you would say if you were presenting this in-person to the group.
In addition to the presentation, you will write a 4-5 page paper that covers the following items:

Software title and home page information
The purpose of the software and its historical context.
Details of installation and configuration procedure.
Overview of the basic features of the software and how to use it
A personal evaluation of the software
You must get approval from the instructor on the software topics you wish to present.

? You must submit your open source tool selection by the end of Week 5.
Your project will be due in week 7 or week 8 (the instructor will post a schedule of due dates in the course announcements once topics are approved.)
Your presentation and your paper will be posted to a discussion forum, and everyone in the class will be evaluating your topic.

Remember, your software topic MUST BE APPROVED by the instructor.
